# What's this for?

After over four years of working as a self taught developer, my manager though it would be good for me to nail down the fundamentals. He recommended the Frontend Roadmap and I started working through it. It was super good but I wasn't connecting to the material, just reading through it. I needed a goal, to create something, I needed the knowledge to be _for_ something. So I decided to give this a try, creating a Journal, an Open Educational Resource (I know there's not shortage, but here's mine). Hope it finds some good use.

Also know that it is a work in progress, you will see unfinished pages open questions and mistakes.
