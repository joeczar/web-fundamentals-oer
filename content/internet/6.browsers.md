# How Browsers Work

The browser is your interface to the matrix — but it's doing an enormous amount of work to turn raw data into what you see on screen. Most developers use browsers all day without understanding what's happening inside them.

## What this module will cover

- The main components of a browser engine: networking, rendering, JavaScript runtime
- The critical rendering path: HTML → DOM → CSSOM → render tree → paint
- How JavaScript execution interacts with rendering (and why blocking matters)
- Browser caching: what gets stored and for how long
- Developer tools: the browser as a debugging environment
- Cross-browser differences — why they exist and how to handle them

## Why it matters

Everything you build for the web ends up in a browser. Understanding what browsers do with your code — in what order, and why — is the difference between guessing and knowing.
