# Domain Names

A domain name is a human-readable address for a location in the matrix. Behind the simplicity is a global, distributed system of registrars, registries, and root servers.

## What this module will cover

- The anatomy of a domain name: protocol, subdomain, SLD, TLD
- Who controls domain names — ICANN, registries, registrars
- How to register a domain and what happens when you do
- The difference between a domain and a URL
- Country-code TLDs vs generic TLDs
- Domain expiry — what happens when someone forgets to renew

## Why it matters

Domain names are the coordinates of the web. Knowing how they're structured — and who controls them — gives you a clearer picture of how the internet's governance actually works.
