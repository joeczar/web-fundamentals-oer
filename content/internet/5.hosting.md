# Web Hosting

A website only exists on the public internet if it's running on a server that's always on and always connected. That's hosting — and there's a lot more to it than picking a plan.

## What this module will cover

- What a web server actually does
- Shared hosting vs VPS vs dedicated servers vs cloud
- Static hosting vs dynamic hosting — and when each makes sense
- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks): what they are and why they're used
- Deployment pipelines: from code on your laptop to live on the internet
- Domains + hosting: how DNS and servers connect

## Why it matters

Choosing where and how to host affects performance, cost, reliability, and security. Understanding the tradeoffs means you can make better decisions — and debug problems when something goes wrong.
