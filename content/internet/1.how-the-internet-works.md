## Clients and Servers

Sadly your favorite restaurant don't randomly send out deliveries to you, you have to make a request. Whether you eat at the restaurant order at the drive through or get it delivered, you have to ask for it. The same goes for the internet, you have to ask for the data you want. When you type in a url, you are asking for a webpage, when you click on an app, you are asking for data to be sent to your phone. The servers are the ones that have the data and they send it to you when you ask for it.

So, what exactly are clients and servers? A client is simply software (email, browser, app) or device (computer, phone) that requests and displays data from a server. A server is a computer or software that stores, processes and delivers data. When you give your order in the delivery app (a client btw), you are also acting as the client. The restaurant is the server. It receives your order, prepares your food, notifies the delivery person who brings it to you. And instead of displaying the data, you're eating the food (I hope).

### Internet Connection

Your trusty delivery person doesn't transport magically to your door, they have to move through the streets, under tunnels and over bridges to get to you. The internet is the same, it has to move through physical cables, copper or fiber optic, and wireless signals like WiFi or 5G signals, go through routers and cell towers to get to you. You can think of WiFi, 5G, fiber optic and copper cables as the roads, tunnels and bridges of the internet. They are the physical infrastructure that allows data to travel from servers to clients. The Cell towers and routers are the traffic lights and intersections that help direct the flow of data.
