# DNS (Domain Name System)

Every node in the matrix has an address. But humans don't speak in numbers — they speak in names. DNS is the system that translates between the two.

## What this module will cover

- What a domain name actually is — and what it isn't
- The hierarchy: TLDs, second-level domains, subdomains
- How a DNS query travels across the network and comes back with an answer
- DNS record types: A, CNAME, MX, TXT and what they're used for
- DNS caching — why changes don't happen instantly
- What happens when DNS fails

## Why it matters

When you type `github.com` into a browser, nothing happens until DNS resolves that name to an IP address. Understanding DNS means understanding how the addressing layer of the internet actually works — and why it's both elegant and fragile.
