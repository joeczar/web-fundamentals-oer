# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the language of the web — the protocol that defines how clients ask for data and how servers respond. Every page you've ever loaded was delivered over HTTP.

## What this module will cover

- The request/response cycle: what a request looks like, what a response looks like
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and when to use each
- Status codes: what 200, 301, 404, 500 actually mean
- HTTP headers — metadata that travels with every request
- HTTP vs HTTPS: what TLS adds and why it matters
- HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 — how the protocol evolved

## Why it matters

HTTP is the contract between browsers and servers. Every API call, every form submission, every image load — all of it is HTTP. You can't build for the web without understanding the protocol underneath.
